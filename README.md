# Learning Internet-of-Things: IoT Basic Experiments using ESP8266, Arduino and Xbee
This is a simple trainer kit module to help you understand the basic concept of IoT infrastructure. 
This project is powered by Faculty of Engineering, Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia (AJCUI)

There are 7 (seven) experiments that will cover three IoT segmentation:
- Device
- Connectivity
- Cloud and Application

Schematic design for our IoT Trainer is shown below:
